# üçΩÔ∏è BiteSight

**BiteSight** is a data analytics pipeline that leverages Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark (PySpark) to uncover insights from Yelp's food business reviews across the U.S. It provides sentiment analysis, trend detection, category-based hotspots, and personalized recommendations‚Äîall visualized via an interactive dashboard.

## üîç Project Overview

Yelp contains millions of reviews that are often overwhelming for users to interpret and difficult for businesses to analyze. **BiteSight** solves this by:

- Helping **users** discover top-rated food spots and trends.
- Assisting **food businesses** in understanding customer feedback and rating dynamics.

The system focuses on food-related businesses in the U.S., extracted from Yelp‚Äôs open dataset (~6.99M reviews and 150K businesses).
